## Project Plan: Natural Language Database Query Dashboard (Frontend)

**1. Project Title:** Natural Language Database Query Dashboard (Frontend)

**2. Introduction:**
This document outlines the plan for developing a modern, responsive frontend dashboard application using Next.js. This application will serve as the user interface for interacting with the existing FastAPI backend, which translates natural language questions into SQL queries and executes them against a database. The goal is to provide a user-friendly experience that democratizes data access for non-technical users.

**3. Goals:**
* Develop a highly interactive and intuitive user interface for submitting natural language database queries.
* Clearly display query results in a user-friendly format (tables, text).
* Implement features to enhance user experience, such as query history and saving.
* Ensure the application is performant and responsive across different devices.
* Provide a foundation for potential future enhancements like data visualization and administrative features.

**4. Key Features:**

Based on the brainstorming, the following features are planned for implementation:

* **Core Querying Interface:**
    * Prominent text input area for natural language questions.
    * "Submit" button to send the query to the backend API.
    * Loading indicator while waiting for the API response.
    * Dynamic results display area supporting both tabular data (with basic features like scrolling) and plain text.
    * Clear display of error messages returned by the API.

* **User Experience Enhancements (Phase 1 or 2):**
    * Display of recent query history (persisted locally in the browser or via a simple backend service if preferred).
    * Option to clear query history.
    * Display of suggested or example queries to guide users.

* **Backend Integration:**
    * Seamless integration with the `/query` POST endpoint of the existing FastAPI backend.
    * Handling of API request and response payloads according to the backend's defined models (`QueryRequest`, `QueryResponse`).

**5. Technology Stack:**

* **Framework:** Next.js (React Framework)
* **Language:** TypeScript (for type safety)
* **Styling:** (Choose one based on preference/team experience)
    * CSS Modules
    * Tailwind CSS
    * Styled Components or Emotion
    * A UI Component Library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI - provides pre-built components like tables, buttons, inputs)
* **Data Fetching:** `Workspace` API or a library like Axios. React Query or SWR can be considered for more advanced caching and state management around data fetching.
* **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useReducer` for local component state. React Context or a library like Zustand/Jotai for more global state if needed (e.g., query history). Redux Toolkit is an option for larger, more complex state, but might be overkill initially.
* **Data Table:** A React-based data table library (e.g., React Table v7/v8, Ag-Grid Community, TanStack Table) for displaying tabular query results.

**6. Architecture and Structure:**

The Next.js application will follow a standard structure:

* **`pages/`:** Contains route-based files. `pages/index.tsx` will likely be the main dashboard page.
* **`components/`:** Reusable React components (e.g., `QueryInput`, `ResultsDisplay`, `QueryHistoryList`, `DataTable`, `LoadingSpinner`).
* **`lib/` or `utils/`:** Utility functions (e.g., API call helpers, data formatting).
* **`types/`:** TypeScript type definitions (matching backend models where applicable).
* **`api/` (Optional):** Next.js API routes could be used as a very thin layer between the frontend and the Python backend if needed, but direct client-side calls to the FastAPI backend are also feasible.
* **Styling Files:** Organized according to the chosen styling method.

The application will primarily utilize Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for the interactive dashboard elements, as the content is dynamic and depends on user input and API responses. Static Generation could be used for static pages like an "About" or "Help" page if necessary.

**7. API Integration:**

* A dedicated function or module will be created to handle communication with the backend API.
* This function will take the natural language query string as input.
* It will make a POST request to the configured backend `/query` endpoint, sending the query within the request body as defined by the `QueryRequest` model.
* It will handle the API response, parsing the JSON data according to the `QueryResponse` model.
* Error handling will be implemented to catch API errors and display user-friendly messages.
* The backend API endpoint URL will likely be configured via environment variables (`.env.local`) for flexibility across different deployment environments.

**8. UI/UX Design:**

* Focus on a clean, intuitive, and uncluttered layout.
* Use clear typography and visual hierarchy.
* Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* Consider accessibility guidelines (WCAG).
* A simple wireframe or mockup process will precede development to define the layout and component placement.
* The chosen styling approach/component library will dictate the visual style.

**9. Development Phases (Proposed):**

* **Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)**
    * Set up Next.js project structure.
    * Implement the basic query input and submit functionality.
    * Implement API integration to send queries and receive responses.
    * Develop the results display area to show raw text responses.
    * Implement basic error handling and loading states.
* **Phase 2: Enhanced Results Display & UX**
    * Implement logic to detect and display tabular data in a data table component.
    * Add basic styling to the data table (headers, rows).
    * Implement query history display.
    * Add example queries.
* **Phase 3: Refinements and Polish**
    * Improve styling and overall look and feel.
    * Enhance error messages for clarity.
    * Add input validation (e.g., preventing empty queries).
    * Ensure responsiveness and test on different devices.

**10. Potential Future Enhancements:**

* Advanced features for the data table (sorting, pagination, filtering).
* Saving of queries.
* Database schema browser (requires backend API extension).
* Data visualization capabilities (basic charts).
* User authentication and multi-user features (if applicable).
* Administrator settings for backend configuration.

**11. Team and Resources:**

* (Specify team size, roles, e.g., 1-2 Frontend Developers)
* Requires expertise in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and interacting with REST APIs.

**12. Risks and Challenges:**

* Accurately parsing and displaying the diverse types of responses the backend might return (text vs. structured data).
* Designing a data table component that is flexible and handles different data schemas gracefully.
* Managing state for features like query history, especially if planning for persistence.
* Potential complexities in integrating charting libraries if visualization is pursued later.
